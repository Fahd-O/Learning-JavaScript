# JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository contains HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files created as part of my self-development journey to enhance my JavaScript programming skills. The code files follow along with the **JavaScript Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (9 HOURS!)** by **Caleb Curry** on YouTube.

## Repository Overview

The files in this repository are structured to match the episodes of Caleb Curry's tutorial series. Each file demonstrates a concept or exercise covered in the corresponding episode.

### Key Notes

- **File Numbering:** After **file number 7**, the numbering aligns with the episode numbers in the tutorial series. Episodes without coding exercises do not have associated files, so no files are missing.
- **Learning Focus:** This repository showcases key concepts in JavaScript, from foundational syntax to more advanced topics, with examples implemented in tandem with the video tutorials.

### Notes to Self

- Explore **DevMountain** for bootcamps on real-world JavaScript projects to further enhance practical knowledge and project-based learning.

## Folder Contents

The repository contains:

- **HTML Files:** Demonstrating integration with JavaScript and structuring web pages.
- **JavaScript Files:** Core focus of the tutorials, showcasing a range of JavaScript concepts and practices.
- **CSS Files:** Supporting styling for some HTML pages.

This repository serves as a practical archive of my progress in JavaScript, offering a hands-on exploration of programming concepts.
