# WHAT IT IS

This here folder contains files (HTML, JS and CSS) created to follow up the **JavaScript Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (9 HOURS!)** by **Caleb Curry** on YouTube.

## Notes

- File numbering after **file number 7**, is the episode number of the tutorial video, so one should not be confused or think that some files are missing. Some episodes simply don't have any file created for them as there is no code to write for them.

## Note to self

- checkout 'DevMountain' for bootcamp on JavaScript real world projects
