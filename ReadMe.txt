                            *** WHAT IT IS ***
* This here folder contains files (HTML, JS, CSS and maybe others) created to follow up the **JavaScript Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (9 HOURS!)** by **Caleb Curry**
*
*
                            *** Notes ***
* File numbering after **file number 7**, is the episode number of the tutorial video, so one should not be confused or think that some files are missing. Some episodes simply don't have any file created for them as there is no code to write for them.
